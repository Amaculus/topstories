Sleeper Promo Code TOPACTION: Play Entries on Seahawks vs. Cardinals TNF
The Seattle Seahawks and the Arizona Cardinals face off at 8:15 p.m. ET tonight on Thursday Night Football. Sign up with the Sleeper Fantasy promo code ACTION today to get a 100% deposit match of up to $100 in bonus funds, which can be used to create entries on the game.
There are two different ways to play entries at Sleeper Fantasy: Max or Flex. A Max entry provides the largest payout multiplier and requires all of your selections to win to receive it. Alternatively, a Flex entry provides a smaller payout if you go perfect, while also providing an even smaller payout back if you lose just one pick.
Here is an example of an entry I created using picks from Thursday Night Football with the Sleeper Fantasy promo code ACTION:
- Sam Darnold LESS than 223.5 Passing Yards
- Kyler Murray MORE than 30.5 Rushing Yards
- Trey Benson MORE than 59.5 Rushing Yards
This entry has a 6.3x payout multiplier as a Max. If I place it for $10 and win all of my picks, I receive a $63 total payout ($53 profit + $10 entry back).
