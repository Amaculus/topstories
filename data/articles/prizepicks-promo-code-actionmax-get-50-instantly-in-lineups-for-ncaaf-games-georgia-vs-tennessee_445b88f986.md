How to Use PrizePicks Promo Code ACTIONMAX for NCAAF Lineup
To get started, claim the PrizePicks promo code ACTIONMAX and submit your first lineup. Decide whether each player projection exceeds ("More") or falls short ("Less") and add these selections to your lineup. You may include up to six picks.
In my example, I have two picks from the Georgia vs. Tennessee game on college football Saturday. Additionally, there is a "free square" for Travis Kelce's receiving yardsâ€”this pick wins as long as he gains at least one yard.
- Travis Kelce (Kansas City Chiefs) More Than 0.5 Receiving Yards
- X
- X
When you compile a lineup with three or more picks, you must choose between a Power Play and a Flex Play. The Power Play offers a 6x payout if all picks win. Alternatively, the Flex Play provides a 3x payout for a perfect lineup, or a refund of your stake (1x payout) if you win a 2-for-3 lineup.
