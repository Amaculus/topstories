The Kentucky Derby is among the most popular betting events in the U.S., and you can bet on it on your phone in far more states than you can bet legally on sports. Don't miss out on the 2025 Kentucky Derby on Saturday, May 3.
A total of 41 states have online horse racing betting, with Texas having an in-person option. North Carolina legalized horse betting when it legalized sports betting in March 2024, but is yet to launch.
There are a few unique quirks about horse racing betting apps you should know:
- Most horse betting apps are separate from sportsbook apps. FanDuel is the only one to integrate it into their sportsbook (in some states). DraftKings has a separate app called DK Horse.
- But FanDuel Racing also exists as a standalone app for users in both sports betting and non-sports betting states.
- Some states have exclusive apps, like New Jersey's 4NJBets, which is just a white-labeled version of the TVG app.
- U.S. horse betting platforms use parimutuel odds, which means the odds are dictated directly by how much money is being wagered on each horse. It also means your odds can and will change after you've placed the bet.
Horse Racing Betting Sites Per State
Multiple betting sites are available for horse racing, but not every state has the same option. TwinSpires and TVG are available in most states, but what about others?
