How Does the Fanatics Sportsbook Fair Play Policy Work?
Fanatics Sportsbook recently instituted something called the Fair Play policy which helps protect bettors from the variance and unlucky outcomes of player props. In rare instances, a player you bet on sustains an injury early on in a game and does not return. This makes Over bets on player props extremely difficult to win, and as a result, the Fair Play policy works to refund bettors their stake in such scenarios.
Here is a look at how each sport works within the Fair Play policy:
- NFL & NCAAF: If a player sustains an injury in the first quarter of a game and does not return.
- NBA & WNBA: If a player sustains an injury in the first quarter of a game and does not return.
- NHL: If a player sustains an injury in the first period of a game and does not return.
- MLB Hitters: If a hitter records a plate appearance and then is forced out of the game before recording a second plate appearance.
- MLB Pitchers: If a pitcher throws more than one pitch and is forced from the game before recording three outs.
