Chiefs vs. Chargers NFL Week 1 Info

- Moneyline: Chiefs (-175) | Chargers (+145)

Since the BetMGM bonus code ACTIONGET requires your $10+ first bet win to pocket $150 in bonus bets, I suggest you play it conservatively when placing your first bet. This means longshot bets and parlays are to be avoided in favor of more favorable odds, which can be found on markets like ALT spreads and ALT totals.
For example, a bet I like is Chargers +13.5 (-550). While the Chiefs are favored entering this game, I think the Chargers are built to keep this game close with their run-first offensive philosophy. As long as the Chargers don't lose by 14 or more points, you get issued $150 in bonus bets when you register with the BetMGM bonus code ACTIONGET and place a successful $10+ bet on that Chargers ALT spread.
