Take advantage of the bet365 bonus code TOPACTION to choose between two welcome offers: a $300 bet-and-get promo or a $1,000 First Bet Safety Net. Whichever you choose, make sure your initial bet is on a market with odds of -500 or longer.
For the bet-and-get promo, use the bet365 bonus code TOPACTION and place a $5 first bet to unlock $300 in bonus bets, regardless of the outcome. Alternatively, with the First Bet Safety Net promo, you get bonus bets only if your first bet doesn't win. You can place these bets on college football games or any sporting event this weekend.

bet365 Bonus Code TOPACTION: Bet on Saturday NCAAF Games
Don't miss the opportunity to use the bet365 bonus code TOPACTION to unlock your welcome bonus for NCAAF games on Saturday. While you can place bets on any game, the major matchups featured are Georgia vs. Tennessee (3:30 p.m. ET on ABC) and Texas A&M vs. Notre Dame (7:30 p.m. ET on NBC).
For example, with the bet-and-get promo, if you wager $5 on the Tennessee moneyline (+145), you get $300 in bonus bets regardless of the outcome. However, if Tennessee wins, you also earn a $12.25 payout.
Alternatively, you might consider the $1,000 First Bet Safety Net promo using the Texas A&M vs. Notre Dame game. Notre Dame is a seven-point favorite (-110). If you bet $1,000 on Notre Dame to cover the spread and they do, you retain your $1,000 stake and earn a $909.09 profit. If your initial bet loses, bet365 gives you $1,000 in bonus bets, which you can use for seven days.
