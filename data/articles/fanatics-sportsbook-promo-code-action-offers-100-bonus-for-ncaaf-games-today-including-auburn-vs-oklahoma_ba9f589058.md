Fanatics Sportsbook Promo Code ACTION: Bet on Auburn vs. Oklahoma NCAAF Game
Sign up now using the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION and claim your No Sweat Football Bet for any NCAAF game, including Auburn vs. Oklahoma. Tune into this battle of SEC foes at 3:30 p.m. ET on ABC.
Both teams enter this matchup at 3-0, but Oklahoma has looked like the better team, highlighted by a big home victory against Michigan on September 6. Fanatics Sportsbook lists Oklahoma as a seven-point favorite as they look to improve to 4-0.
I like Oklahoma in this matchup, but we need an alternative way to bet on them to meet the +300 odds requirement. If you believe in a low-scoring game, you could wager $100 on both teams not to score 10+ points (+375).
- Auburn vs. Oklahoma Prediction: Both Teams Not to Score 10+ Points (+375)
If either Auburn or Oklahoma fails to score 10 points in today's college football game, you keep your $100 stake and earn a $375 profit. If your No Sweat Football Bet loses, you get $100 in FanCash. You can use your FanCash to purchase jerseys, hats, or other merchandise, but it expires at the end of October.
Don't miss your chance to claim a welcome bonus with the Fanatics Sportsbook promo code ACTION. Check out the latest NCAAF odds before wagering on any game today.
